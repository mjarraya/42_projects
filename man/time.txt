     The ttiimmee utility executes and times _u_t_i_l_i_t_y.  After the _u_t_i_l_i_t_y finishes,
     ttiimmee writes the total time elapsed, the time consumed by system overhead,
     and the time used to execute _u_t_i_l_i_t_y to the standard error stream.  Times
     are reported in seconds.

     Available options:

     --ll      The contents of the _r_u_s_a_g_e structure are printed.

     --pp      The output is formatted as specified by IEEE Std 1003.2-1992
             (``POSIX.2'').

     Some shells may provide a builtin ttiimmee command which is similar or iden-
     tical to this utility.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page.

     The ttiimmee utility shall exit with one of the following values:

     1-125   An error occurred in the ttiimmee utility.

     126     The _u_t_i_l_i_t_y was found but could not be invoked.

     127     The _u_t_i_l_i_t_y could not be found.

     Otherwise, the exit status of ttiimmee shall be that of _u_t_i_l_i_t_y.

     The granularity of seconds on microprocessors is crude and can result in
     times being reported for CPU usage which are too large by a second.
